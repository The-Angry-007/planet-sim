x convert path in planet to list of paths, so that when merged there can be multiple
x make paths render before anything else
x ability to place planets that dont move
x make path predictor actually update the other planets too somehow
x figure out some optimisations for the path predictor
x change icon to be planets related
x move header files to an include folder
x make old paths start to disappear - give each point a timestamp?
x add input handler class
- add gui buttons - add planet, select planet, time slider, delete planet etc
	-half finished:
	x added class for button, need to make them function
	- need to add class for text labels
	- need to add class for time slider
- add some sort of camera class - allows you to zoom in and out and pan around
- use triangles instead of lines for paths so that they are smaller
- when an object is moving, check if the distance from where it is to the first point on the path is below a threshold. if so, then set it to repeating and make it just follow its original path.
- make the timesteps fixed - variation means the simulation is not deterministic :(
- add physics class to encapsulate all of the random global variables and stuff
- reimplement density
	- mass and volume are conserved when creating a new object, so density is just (m1+m2)/(v1+v2)

NEW GAME PLAN!!!!
resource management game - start with basic resources, such as petrol and iron or something. use this to build crappy rocket that can only just make it to moon
- limited oxygen and water on board too, cant go too long without refilling
- on the moon, some new metal is discovered that can make the rockets more lightweight and therefore go further.
this can also be used to make a petrol refinery, which means that less of it is burnt.
- on mars, another type of metal is found that is heavy, but can withstand greater pressure and temperature. this can be used for missions
that go close to the sun, increasing the oxygen and water supply on the rocket, and to make a slightly more efficient thruster.
- on asteroids, other rare metals such as platinum, gold etc can be found that can allow for electronics that show you what resources are on planets etc
- nuclear fission and fusion could eventually be reached, with uranium / thorium located on venus or something and helium / hydrogen extracted from water
with sufficient electronics.

DEVELOPMENT PLAN
most important features:
Week 1 - 18/3/24 - 24/3/24
- start new project, carry over the inputHandler class
- create menu class that allows you to load a game, start a game, quit, change options (which will be blank)
- create game class that takes over when you load in, also has pause menu and settings
Week 2 - 25/3/24 - 31/3/24
- Implement perlin noise - needed for height of terrain
- Util function that takes in 2 polygons
