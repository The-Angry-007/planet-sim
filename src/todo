NEW GAME PLAN!!!!
resource management game - start with basic resources, such as petrol and iron or something. use this to build crappy rocket that can only just make it to moon
- limited oxygen and water on board too, cant go too long without refilling
- on the moon, some new metal is discovered that can make the rockets more lightweight and therefore go further.
this can also be used to make a petrol refinery, which means that less of it is burnt.
- on mars, another type of metal is found that is heavy, but can withstand greater pressure and temperature. this can be used for missions
that go close to the sun, increasing the oxygen and water supply on the rocket, and to make a slightly more efficient thruster.
- on asteroids, other rare metals such as platinum, gold etc can be found that can allow for electronics that show you what resources are on planets etc
- nuclear fission and fusion could eventually be reached, with uranium / thorium located on venus or something and helium / hydrogen extracted from water
with sufficient electronics.

DEVELOPMENT PLAN


Week 1 - 18/3/24 - 24/3/24
x start new project, carry over the inputHandler and GUI class
x create menu class that allows you to load a game, start a game, quit, change options (which will be blank)
x create game class that takes over when you load in, also has pause menu and settings
####YOU ARE HERE####
Week 2: 25/4 - 31/4
- Create part class that has mass, position, rotation and box2d component
- each subclass has an id, which links to a specific texture
- create subclass for thruster and subclass for fuel tank
- write a function that can save each subclass and load it in again
- mouse creates force to make sure box2d works properly
- create structure class that has a list of parts, each part is fused together with box2d
- also a 2d array of integers to show what is connected to what
	- for n parts, the outer array is n items long and the inner is however many are connected to the ith part
- add camera class, and can set it to follow a structure
- thruster can actually thrust
- gui to show the capacity of any fuel tanks of the selected structure, if 2 are connected show as one big bar
- maybe add a few other subclasses and then call it quits
Week 3: 1/4 - 7/4
- check if mouse is clicking on a structure, if so bring up a little window with a structure name, option to rename, option to take control
- add planet class, has a colour, radius, mass, atmosphere radius, radius of influence, height array (given by perlin noise)
- figure out how to render the concave polygon
- arrange all of the planets like in the real solar system
- add map, where the scale is like a million times less or something
- click to drag round the map
- make the position of the planets saved
- use elliptical orbit formula on laptop to draw the path of each planet
Week 4: 8/4 - 14/4
- camera automatically goes back to earth if structure following is destroyed, syncs with planets rotation and position
- each structure is given a little icon on the map to track them
- apply the formula to structures to find their gravity
- implement a vast range of parts
- add a time speed slider to the gui
- create a rocket build menu where theres a catelog of parts that can be placed on a grid
Week 5: 15/4 - 21/4
- create an item class that is just an id and a value, add function to render at a given position and size
- create an inventory class that has a number of slots and max stack, can also be rendered
- has a search bar at the top if enabled to find items easier
- add some placeholder items such as wood and stone
- add another class for fixed structures that cant move around, and add storage silo to this
- make a crafter that can be linked to silos, shows all possible recipes when clicked on
Week 6: 22/4 - 28/4
- add recipe for drill, windmill to power drill, forge, better drill, etc the basic starter items up until a few rocket parts
- make rocket designer menu draw from the items
- essentially just add the actual content of the game and build up the amount of items and stuff.
- maybe make all the uis look better and stuff
Week 7: 29/4 - 5/5
- add some sort of power system - copper used to make wires that can transfer energy to different electrical components, all of the best components require constant energy
- add different materials to be found on different planets, this will link to the crafting tree next week
Week 8 (+ maybe 9): 6/5 - 12/5
- create a crafting tree menu that shows whats on different planets. to unlock the different stages of the crafting tree, you have to have a research centre on the previous stage
	- the earth is the first obviously, then the moon. to unlock the moon tree, you have to have a satellite with a research centre orbiting the earth, that gives you research points (based on real time not game time)
	- then moon research system, which will get you mars etc etc.

boom finished game :D

potential ideas:
some sort of power system, similar to that in create:new age
this links to the drill progression idea below

PROGRESSION IDEAS
all you have to start out with is a storage silo and a big platform to build rockets on.
when items drop on the ground, you have to click and drag them into the storage silo before you can use them.
trees will be dotted around, so if you break a tree you can collect wood
stones will be dotted around too
these combined can make a crafter, hand crank and drill
the hand crank connected to the drill with it pointed in the ground will make it start digging, which will cause stones to appear out the top
the crank has to be clicked for it to turn
enough stone will allow you to craft a forge.
there will also be a chance for the drill to find iron, which can be melted in the forge.
this can be used to make a better drill and so on.
then a petrol miner can be made, a refinery made, this can be used to build rocket, so on and so forth.

im thinking pipes can be made to transport items, wires to transport power, this means that you could have an unloading station for your rocket so that when you land all your items are automatically moved into your silo.



IMPORTANT GAMEPLAY NOTES
try and make as little stuff as possible rely on time, this is for 2 main reasons
	- a: i hate having to wait for stuff in games, its so boring
	- b: i need to have time skipping be a feature for long missions, which would completely fuck up stuff that relies on time
if anything absolutely has to, such as the research centres, make them run off real time and not gameplay time.
