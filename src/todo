NEW GAME PLAN!!!!
resource management game - start with basic resources, such as petrol and iron or something. use this to build crappy rocket that can only just make it to moon
- limited oxygen and water on board too, cant go too long without refilling
- on the moon, some new metal is discovered that can make the rockets more lightweight and therefore go further.
this can also be used to make a petrol refinery, which means that less of it is burnt.
- on mars, another type of metal is found that is heavy, but can withstand greater pressure and temperature. this can be used for missions
that go close to the sun, increasing the oxygen and water supply on the rocket, and to make a slightly more efficient thruster.
- on asteroids, other rare metals such as platinum, gold etc can be found that can allow for electronics that show you what resources are on planets etc
- nuclear fission and fusion could eventually be reached, with uranium / thorium located on venus or something and helium / hydrogen extracted from water
with sufficient electronics.

DEVELOPMENT PLAN


Week 1 - 18/3/24 - 24/3/24
x start new project, carry over the inputHandler and GUI class
####YOU ARE HERE####
- create menu class that allows you to load a game, start a game, quit, change options (which will be blank)
- create game class that takes over when you load in, also has pause menu and settings
Week 2-3 - 25/3/24 - 7/4/24 (v0.2)
- Implement perlin noise - needed for height of planet surface
- planet class that has a surface made from perlin noise
- figure out how to render the polygon - ear clipping algorithm, find centre and create wedges,fuck knows
- polygon collision detection algorithm
- make camera follow curvature of planet when within atmosphere bounds
Week 4-6 - 8/4/24 - 28/4/24 (v0.3)
- make representation of the solar system, visible by opening map menu
- this shows a little X where the camera is, and all planets are represented by icons with big circles to show their orbits
- build part class - has a few main features, including texture, collision mesh, rotation, position, list of connected parts, mass, temperature
there are subclasses such as fuel tank, thruster, storage silo etc with their own property
- structure class - has a list of parts and a centre of mass, this is for the thruster
- design some sort of physics engine to handle the structures moving around
- thrusters can engage and will exert thrust, but drain fuel of any connected fuel tanks
- whole range of parts that are good enough to get to moon
Week 7 - 29/4/24 - 5/5/24 (v0.4)
- UI DESIGN
- build rocket menu where there is a grid like in sfs, with all the parts on the left
- design inventory system - create item class where each item has an integer id and texture, etc
- ui to show an inventory of a specified width and height, used to show whats on ground and whats in silos
- create storage silos that go on ground and some new parts to support this
- add drill where it detects what planet is beneath it and adds to storage silo based on this. slowly consumes fuel.
different ores could have different rarities and the further down you dig, the higher the chance of getting rare ores.
different drills both increase speed and chance of getting high rarity ore.

potential ideas:
some sort of power system, similar to that in create:new age
this links to the drill progression idea below

PROGRESSION IDEAS
all you have to start out with is a storage silo and a big platform to build rockets on.
when items drop on the ground, you have to click and drag them into the storage silo before you can use them.
trees will be dotted around, so if you break a tree you can collect wood
stones will be dotted around too
these combined can make a crafter, hand crank and drill
the hand crank connected to the drill with it pointed in the ground will make it start digging, which will cause stones to appear out the top
the crank has to be clicked for it to turn
enough stone will allow you to craft a forge.
there will also be a chance for the drill to find iron, which can be melted in the forge.
this can be used to make a better drill and so on.
then a petrol miner can be made, a refinery made, this can be used to build rocket, so on and so forth.

im thinking pipes can be made to transport items, wires to transport power, this means that you could have an unloading station for your rocket so that when you land all your items are automatically moved into your silo.
